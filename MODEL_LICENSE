(if you are entering into this agreement on behalf of your employer or other entity) (“Licensee” or “you”) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta” or “we”)
applies to your use of any computer program, algorithm, source code, object code, or software that is made available by Meta under this License
(“Software”) and any specifications, manuals, documentation, and other written information provided by Meta related to the Software (“Documentation”).

By clicking “I Accept” below or by using the Software, you agree to the terms of this License. If you do not agree to this License, then you do not

access the Software Products on behalf of your employer or other entity.

your non-commercial research purposes. The foregoing license is personal to you, and you may not assign or sublicense this License or any other rights or

DISCLAIMERS

THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” and “WITH ALL FAULTS” WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. META EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS 
AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, CUSTOM, USAGE OR OTHERWISE AS TO ANY MATTERS RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. META MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR 
REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WILL BE ERROR FREE OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR PRODUCE ANY PARTICULAR RESULTS.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL META BE LIABLE TO YOU (A) UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, 
STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE UNDER THIS LICENSE, OR (B) FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OR LOST
PROFITS, EVEN IF META HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, THEIR CONSTITUENT COMPONENTS, AND ANY OUTPUT (COLLECTIVELY, 
“SOFTWARE MATERIALS”) ARE NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN ANY APPLICATION OR SITUATION WHERE FAILURE OR FAULT OF THE SOFTWARE MATERIALS COULD REASONABLY BE
ANTICIPATED TO LEAD TO SERIOUS INJURY OF ANY PERSON, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION OR VIOLATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL’S PRIVACY RIGHTS, OR TO SEVERE PHYSICAL, 
PROPERTY, OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (EACH, A “HIGH-RISK USE”). IF YOU ELECT TO USE ANY OF THE SOFTWARE MATERIALS FOR A HIGH-RISK USE, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK. 
YOU AGREE TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE DECISION-MAKING AND RISK-MITIGATION PROCEDURES AND POLICIES IN CONNECTION WITH A HIGH-RISK USE SUCH THAT EVEN IF 
THERE IS A FAILURE OR FAULT IN ANY OF THE SOFTWARE MATERIALS, THE SAFETY OF PERSONS OR PROPERTY AFFECTED BY THE ACTIVITY STAYS AT A LEVEL THAT IS REASONABLE, 
APPROPRIATE, AND LAWFUL FOR THE FIELD OF THE HIGH-RISK USE.


INDEMNIFICATION

You will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Meta and our subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of our respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, successors, and assigns (collectively, the “Meta Parties”) from and against any losses, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties, and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by any Meta Party in connection with any claim, demand, allegation, lawsuit, proceeding, or investigation (collectively, 
“Claims”) arising out of or related to: (a) your access to or use of the Software Products (as well as any results or data generated from such access or use),
including any High-Risk Use (defined below); (b) your violation of this License; or (c) your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another
(including intellectual property or other proprietary rights and privacy rights). You will promptly notify the Meta Parties of any such Claims, and cooperate 
with Meta Parties in defending such Claims. You will also grant the Meta Parties sole control of the defense or settlement, at Meta’s sole option, of any Claims. 
This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities or remedies set forth in a written agreement between you and Meta or the other Meta 
Parties.

THIRD PARTY MATERIALS

The Software Products may contain third-party software or other components (including free and open source software) (all of the foregoing, “Third Party Materials”),
which are subject to the license terms of the respective third-party licensors. Your dealings or correspondence with third parties and your use of or interaction

permission of Meta, except to the extent necessary to make the reference required by the “ATTRIBUTION” section of this Agreement.


APPLICABLE LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION

This License will be governed and construed under the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of law provisions. Any suit or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this License will be brought in the federal or state courts, as applicable, in San Mateo County, California, and each party irrevocably 
submits to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.


MISCELLANEOUS

If any provision or part of a provision of this License is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severed from this 
License, and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The failure of Meta to exercise or enforce any right or provision of 
this License will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. This License does not confer any third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or 
entity. This License, together with the Documentation, contains the entire understanding between you and Meta regarding the subject matter of this License, and
supersedes all other written or oral agreements and understandings between you and Meta regarding such subject matter. No change or addition to any provision 
of this License will be binding unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of both you and Meta.
